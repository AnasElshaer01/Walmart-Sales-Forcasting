Individual Models: Train separate models for each time series. In this approach, you would build a separate predictive model for each of the 45*80 time series. This allows you to capture the unique patterns and characteristics of each individual time series. This approach can be useful when the time series have distinct behaviors, different trends, and varying levels of seasonality. However, it can be computationally expensive and require a large amount of data for each individual model.

Multivariate Model: Build a single model to predict all time series together. In this approach, you would develop a multivariate model that takes into account all the 45*80 time series as inputs. This approach allows you to leverage the relationships and interactions between different time series to improve the prediction accuracy. It can be more computationally efficient and require less data compared to training individual models. However, it assumes that there are dependencies or correlations among the different time series.
